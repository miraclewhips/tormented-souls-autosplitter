# Tormented Souls AutoSplitter

To enable the auto-splitter, edit layout and add *Control > Scriptable Autosplitter*.

If it's not showing the in-game-timer for you, make sure to right click LiveSplit and enable *Compare Against > Game Time*, and that your layout timers are also using Game Time.

There are a lot of different auto-split options to choose from in the settings.

The default settings are made to work with the included .lss file ([splits listed in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQqTLATWy2rzE9uD2rtapApFun8kYbugSKjQQ2Q9jRA/edit?usp=sharing)).
